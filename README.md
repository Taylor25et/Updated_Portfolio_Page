## Usage
Greetings! I am an aspiring software developer currently attending class at the University of Washington. Now that I have more coding experience, I was able to fill out more of my page and add some languages that I have learned and some that I hope to learn. I also updated my portfolio section with the assignments we have completed and added a link to my GitHub page and my Resume.
