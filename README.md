# Updated_Portfolio_Page

Feedback from HW2:
Good Job! You have a good start here. There are just a few technical acceptance criteria missing that I have listed below.

Application doesn't include a photo or avatar of the student
In the application's section about their work, the first image isn't larger in size than the others
Clicking on a featured application doesn't open that deployed application (at least one application, in case they are using placeholders)
Code doesn't follow recommended file/folder structure
Code doesn't follow good practices for class/id names, indentation, lacks quality comments
Repo doesn't contain multiple descriptive commit messages
Repository README is missing 1 of the following: description, screenshot, or link to deployed application.
