                <p>Pufferfish aren’t the most graceful swimmers. In fact, they are pretty clumsy and slow. As an adaptation to offset their vulnerability to predators, they can inflate to nearly three times their size using air or water and most pufferfish also have toxins that can make them taste bad or even kill predators that try to eat them. Inflation is temporary and scientists believe poisonous pufferfish synthesize these substances using the bacteria that live on the food they eat.
                    Pufferfish are also responsible for ornate shapes dug into the seafloor that have mystified divers and scientists for decades. These are the result of some species of pufferfishes’ mating rituals where males make beautifully detailed round nests in the sand to attract females.</p>

                <p>Did you know you can recognize a family group of spiders by the way a spider web is designed?  These web-making skills are important to a spider’s survival, and each style helps spiders catch prey in slightly different ways.</p>

                <p>Factoring a quadratic can be done by inspection in easy cases, but in harder cases you need a method. Finding a value of x that makes your equation come out to zero is a good way of finding a factor if you use a computer to search for the value.</p>

                <p>Dolphins have sharp teeth that they usually use to rip apart their prey. Bottlenose dolphins, for example, have between 80 and 100 teeth that they use to grab, grip and secure their prey.</p>
